## Project Overview
### Deliverables
1. The link to a public Git repo containing the code for the web application. The mentor and the assessor must be able to clone the repo, open index.html, use the fully functioning app, and confirm that any user input is validated.
2. A test plan.
### Presentation
You'll do an oral presentation of your project with an assessor in order to imitate real-life conditions. Your assessor, in this case, will play the role of the client (your friend, Sheila). Your evaluation session will proceed as follows:
#### Presentation of deliverables (15 minutes) 
- Explain both your creative choices in designing your online store and your technical choices in how your app uses the functionalities you have learned in JavaScript.
- Explain your development process, i.e., how you implemented progressive improvements throughout development of the app.
#### Discussion (10 minutes)
- Playing the role of client, the assessor will ask you questions about your methodology and your deliverables. 
The assessor will challenge your decisions, so be prepared to defend your work. At the end of the session, the assessor will stop playing the role of client so that you can debrief together.
