## Project Overview
<div>
  <p>Sheila, a friend of yours from school, called you last week, telling you she has been approaching investors for her new online sales business, Orinoco.</p>

  <p>As opposed to an Amazon-style, one site-sells-all web app, Sheila wants to set up specific, themed apps which only sell one group of products each. She knows that you work in web development, so of course she thought of you and was happy to hear that you were interested in contributing.</p>
  <p>Now, a week later, you’ve received a follow-up email:</p>
 <hr>
 
> <p>From: Sheila</p>
> <p>To: Me</p>
> <p>Subject: Orinoco</p>

 <hr>

> <p>Hi,</p>
>  <p>I’ve got some great news! Remember my new online sales business I told you about, Orinoco? Well, I managed to secure investment for it!</p>
>  <p>We need an initial MVP to demonstrate to the investors. I already have someone working on the back end, but immediately thought of you for the front end after our conversation. The investors highly value testing, so if you could also create a test plan at least for the front end to show that it’s part of our roadmap, that would be incredibly helpful.</p>
>  <p>Attached you’ll find the software requirements specification.</p>
>  <p>My back-end developer has already set up APIs for three themed stores. For this first phase, I’ll need the front end for just one of them, so feel free to choose whichever store inspires you the most: handmade teddy bears, vintage cameras, or oak furniture.</p>
>  <p>Looking forward to working with you!</p>
>  <p>Sheila</p>

<p>Excited to help Sheila’s business take off, you dive straight into building the app!</p>

### Deliverables
1. The link to a public Git repo containing the code for the web application. The mentor and the assessor must be able to clone the repo, open index.html, use the fully functioning app, and confirm that any user input is validated.
2. A test plan.
### Presentation
You'll do an oral presentation of your project with an assessor in order to imitate real-life conditions. Your assessor, in this case, will play the role of the client (your friend, Sheila). Your evaluation session will proceed as follows:
#### Presentation of deliverables (15 minutes) 
- Explain both your creative choices in designing your online store and your technical choices in how your app uses the functionalities you have learned in JavaScript.
- Explain your development process, i.e., how you implemented progressive improvements throughout development of the app.
#### Discussion (10 minutes)
- Playing the role of client, the assessor will ask you questions about your methodology and your deliverables. 
The assessor will challenge your decisions, so be prepared to defend your work. At the end of the session, the assessor will stop playing the role of client so that you can debrief together.
